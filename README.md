# Consolitaire
This is my recreation of [Microsoft Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Solitaire) game as a console game.
The goal is to practice writing Rust program and to have fun :)

## Launch
To build and launch the program you can simply execute `cargo run` in the root folder (where `Cargo.toml` file located). _You need to have `cargo` installed!_
